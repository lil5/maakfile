Go has quickly become one of my favorite languages to write in. I often find my self smiling at how easy Go makes almost every task. Detecting file changes is no exception. Using the `filepath` package from the standard library along with `[fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify)`, makes this a fairly simple task.

Out of the box, `fsnotify` provides all the functionality needed to watch a single file or directory:

Unfortunately `fsnotify` doesnâ€™t support recursion, so `filepath` will have to fill in the gaps:

Since `fsnotify` is able to watch all the files in a directory, `filepath` is used to walk the entire document tree looking only for directories to attach watchers to.
